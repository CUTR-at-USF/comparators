comparators
=====================

Library that bundles the LGPL code for Alphanum Algorithm.

The Alphanum Algorithm is an improved sorting algorithm for strings containing numbers.  
Instead of sorting numbers in ASCII order like standard sort, this algorithm sorts numbers in numeric order.
The Alphanum Algorithm is discussed at http://www.DaveKoelle.com
